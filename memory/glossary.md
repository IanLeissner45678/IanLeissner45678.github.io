# Training Glossary

## Workout Types
- **Brick**: Back-to-back bike-run workout, simulates race conditions and muscle adaptation
- **LSD**: Long Slow Distance - aerobic endurance building
- **Tempo**: Sustained moderate-hard effort (~85-90% max HR)
- **Intervals**: High-intensity repeats with recovery periods
- **Recovery**: Easy effort for adaptation and injury prevention
- **Threshold**: At or near lactate threshold, sustainable hard effort
- **Fartlek**: Unstructured speed play, varying pace throughout
- **OWS**: Open Water Swimming - race simulation in lakes/ocean

## Training Zones
- **Zone 1**: Active recovery (50-60% max HR)
- **Zone 2**: Aerobic base (60-70% max HR) - most training happens here
- **Zone 3**: Tempo (70-80% max HR)
- **Zone 4**: Threshold (80-90% max HR)
- **Zone 5**: VO2 max (90-100% max HR)

## Cycling Terms
- **FTP**: Functional Threshold Power - max power sustainable for 1 hour
- **Cadence**: Pedal revolutions per minute (RPM), typically 85-95 for endurance
- **Aerobars**: Time trial bars for aerodynamic position

## Running Terms
- **Negative split**: Running second half faster than first
- **Turnover**: Leg speed, measured in steps per minute
- **Race pace**: Target pace for race day

## Nutrition Terms
- **Carb loading**: Increasing carbohydrate intake before race
- **Bonk**: Running out of glycogen, hitting the wall
- **Fueling window**: Consuming calories during workout (typically starts after 60-90min)
- **Recovery window**: 30-60min post-workout for optimal nutrient absorption

## Race Terms
- **T1**: Transition 1 (swim to bike)
- **T2**: Transition 2 (bike to run)
- **AG**: Age Group
- **DNS**: Did Not Start
- **DNF**: Did Not Finish
- **PR/PB**: Personal Record / Personal Best
