# Training Nutrition Guidelines

## Daily Nutrition Targets

### Macronutrient Ratios (Training Days)
- **Carbohydrates**: 55-65% (6-10g per kg bodyweight)
- **Protein**: 15-20% (1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight)
- **Fats**: 20-25% (0.8-1.2g per kg bodyweight)

### Recovery Days
- **Carbohydrates**: 45-55% (3-5g per kg bodyweight)
- **Protein**: 20-25% (same absolute amount)
- **Fats**: 25-30%

## Workout Nutrition

### Before Training
- **2-3 hours before**: Full meal with carbs + moderate protein
- **30-60 min before**: Small carb snack (banana, toast, energy bar)
- **Hydration**: 16-20 oz water in the 2 hours before

### During Training (>90 minutes)
- **Carbohydrates**: 30-60g per hour
  - Options: gels, chews, bars, sports drink
- **Hydration**: 16-24 oz per hour (adjust for conditions)
- **Electrolytes**: 300-600mg sodium per hour
- **Start early**: Begin fueling at 20-30 minutes, not when hungry

### After Training
- **Within 30 minutes**:
  - Carbs: 1.0-1.2g per kg bodyweight
  - Protein: 20-40g
  - Example: Chocolate milk, recovery shake, meal
- **Within 2 hours**: Full meal with carbs, protein, vegetables

## Race Week Nutrition

### 3-4 Days Before Race
- **Increase carbs to 70%** of calories
- **Reduce fiber** slightly to avoid GI issues
- **Maintain hydration**
- **Reduce training volume** (allows glycogen storage)

### Race Day Morning
- **3-4 hours before**: Familiar breakfast, 200-400g carbs
- **Examples**: Oatmeal, bagels, pancakes, rice
- **Avoid**: High fiber, high fat, anything new
- **Hydration**: 16-20 oz with electrolytes

### During Race Nutrition Plan
- **Swim**: Nothing
- **Bike**:
  - 60-90g carbs per hour
  - 20-24 oz fluid per hour
  - Start at mile 5-10
- **Run**:
  - 30-60g carbs per hour
  - Fluid at every aid station
  - Walk through aid stations if needed

## Food Timing

### High-Carb Meals (Before Key Workouts)
- Oatmeal with banana and honey
- Rice with lean protein
- Pasta with marinara
- Sweet potatoes
- Whole grain toast with nut butter

### High-Protein Recovery Meals
- Grilled chicken with quinoa and vegetables
- Salmon with rice and greens
- Greek yogurt with granola and berries
- Eggs with whole grain toast and avocado
- Protein smoothie with fruit and spinach

### Snacks for Athletes
- Bananas
- Rice cakes with almond butter
- Trail mix
- Energy bars
- Greek yogurt
- Fruit smoothies

## Hydration Strategy
- **Daily baseline**: Half bodyweight (lbs) in ounces
  - Example: 150 lbs = 75 oz water per day minimum
- **Add for training**: 16-24 oz per hour of exercise
- **Sweat test**: Weigh before/after training to calculate losses
- **Urine color**: Pale yellow indicates good hydration

## Supplements to Consider
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, magnesium during long sessions
- **Protein powder**: Convenient recovery option
- **Caffeine**: Strategic use for key workouts and race day (test first!)
- **Iron**: If deficient (get bloodwork)
- **Vitamin D**: If deficient (common in athletes)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Not fueling during workouts** - leads to poor adaptation and bonking
2. **Trying new foods on race day** - recipe for GI disaster
3. **Undereating on recovery days** - impairs adaptation
4. **Neglecting protein** - essential for muscle repair
5. **Dehydration** - even mild dehydration hurts performance
6. **Too much fiber before racing** - causes GI distress
