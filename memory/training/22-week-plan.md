## Red Flags (When to Back Off)
- Persistent fatigue lasting >3 days
- Elevated resting heart rate >10 bpm
- Decreased performance in workouts
- Injury pain (vs. normal muscle soreness)
- Illness or poor sleep >2 nights
- Loss of motivation

**Rule**: When in doubt, take an extra rest day. Missing one workout won't hurt; training injured will destroy your race.
