# Ironman 70.3 Training Overview

## Race Distances
- **Swim**: 1.2 miles (1.9 km)
- **Bike**: 56 miles (90 km)
- **Run**: 13.1 miles (21.1 km)
- **Total**: 70.3 miles

## Typical Training Duration
- **Base Phase**: 12-16 weeks (building aerobic foundation)
- **Build Phase**: 6-8 weeks (increasing intensity and specificity)
- **Peak Phase**: 2-3 weeks (race-specific workouts)
- **Taper**: 2 weeks (reducing volume, maintaining intensity)

## Weekly Training Volume (Build Phase)
- **Hours**: 10-15 hours/week for age groupers
- **Swim**: 3-4 sessions, 8,000-12,000 yards/week
- **Bike**: 3-4 sessions, 100-150 miles/week
- **Run**: 3-4 sessions, 25-35 miles/week
- **Strength**: 1-2 sessions (optional but recommended)

## Key Workouts
### Long Ride
- **When**: Weekends (typically Saturday)
- **Duration**: 2.5-4 hours in build phase
- **Purpose**: Aerobic endurance, mental toughness, race nutrition practice

### Brick Workout
- **When**: Weekly (often after long ride or separate session)
- **Format**: Bike followed immediately by run
- **Purpose**: Teach legs to run off the bike, simulate race fatigue

### Long Run
- **When**: Weekends (typically Sunday, or day after long ride)
- **Duration**: 1.5-2.5 hours in build phase
- **Purpose**: Running endurance, mental preparation

### Threshold/Tempo Sessions
- **Frequency**: 1-2x per week across sports
- **Purpose**: Increase lactate threshold, race pace work

### Swim Endurance
- **When**: 1-2x per week
- **Duration**: 2,500-4,000 yards
- **Purpose**: Building swim-specific endurance

## Training Principles
1. **Consistency over intensity** - showing up regularly matters most
2. **Progressive overload** - gradually increase volume and intensity
3. **Specificity** - mimic race conditions as race approaches
4. **Recovery** - adaptation happens during rest
5. **Brick workouts** - essential for neuromuscular adaptation

## Race Day Strategy
- **Swim**: Controlled effort, stay relaxed, position well
- **T1**: Smooth, no rushing
- **Bike**: Even pacing, avoid going too hard early, fuel consistently
- **T2**: Quick change, mental reset
- **Run**: Negative split if possible, walk aid stations if needed, manage effort
