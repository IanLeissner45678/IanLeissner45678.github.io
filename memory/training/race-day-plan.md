- Large bowl oatmeal with banana, almond butter, honey
- OR: 2 bagels with sunflower seed butter and jam
- Toast with almond butter
- 16-20 oz water with electrolytes
- Optional: Coffee if normal routine

### 5:00-5:30 AM: Travel to Venue
- Arrive 90 minutes before start
- Bring backup nutrition and water
- Body Glide/anti-chafe on wetsuit areas

### 5:30-6:30 AM: Final Prep
- ✅ Bike check: Tires, gears, nutrition on frame
- ✅ T1 setup: Bike shoes, helmet, glasses, race belt
- ✅ T2 setup: Run shoes, socks, hat, fuel
- ✅ Wetsuit on
- ✅ Bathroom (probably multiple times!)
- ✅ Quick 5-10 min swim warm-up if allowed

### 6:45 AM: Pre-Race
- Sip water, small gel 15 min before start
- Get in start corral/position
- Mental prep: "Controlled, steady, strong"

## Swim (1.2 miles, 35-40 min target)

### Strategy
- **Start**: Position based on ability, don't go out with faster swimmers
- **First 200 yards**: CONTROLLED - everyone goes too hard
- **Middle 800 yards**: Find rhythm, settle into stroke, sight every 6-8 strokes
- **Last 200 yards**: Pick up effort slightly, prepare for bike

### Pacing
- Effort: 7/10 (moderate-hard but sustainable)
- Focus: Long, smooth strokes, bilateral breathing
- Sighting: Every 6-8 strokes, use other swimmers if going same direction

### Potential Issues
- **Panic/anxiety**: Stop, flip to back, breathe, then restart
- **Contact**: Stay calm, adjust position
- **Off course**: Sight more frequently, correct early

## T1 (Target: 3-5 minutes)

### Checklist
- ✅ Wetsuit off (strip to waist while running to bike)
- ✅ Helmet on BEFORE touching bike
- ✅ Glasses on
- ✅ Bike shoes on (or start in running shoes if slow transition)
- ✅ Race belt ready
- ✅ Grab bike, jog to mount line

**Don't Rush**: Smooth is fast. Taking an extra 30 seconds to get organized beats fumbling for 2 minutes.

## Bike (56 miles, 3:00-3:15 target = 17-19 mph)

### Strategy
**Miles 0-10: SETTLE IN**
- Legs will feel weird off the swim - NORMAL
- Resist urge to go hard because you feel good
- Target: 17-18 mph, Zone 2 effort
- Start nutrition at mile 5-10

**Miles 10-40: STEADY STATE**
- Find comfortable rhythm
- Aero position when possible
- Fuel consistently (see nutrition below)
- Monitor power/effort, not just speed
- Goal: Even effort regardless of terrain

**Miles 40-56: HOLD STEADY**
- Mental checkpoint: "Save legs for the run!"
- Don't surge on downhills
- Keep fueling until mile 50
- Last 5-6 miles: Begin thinking about T2 and run

### Pacing
- **Effort**: 7.5/10 (comfortably hard, can hold for 3 hours)
- **Power**: If using power meter, ~70-75% FTP
- **Heart Rate**: Zone 2-3, below threshold
- **RPE**: Should be able to speak short sentences

### Bike Nutrition Plan
| Time | Nutrition | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Mile 5-10 | Start fueling | Sip sports drink, first gel |
| Every 15-20 min | Sports drink | 20-24 oz per hour total |
| Every 30-40 min | Gel or food | 60-90g carbs per hour |
| Mile 50 | Last fuel | Give body time to process |

**Specific Fuel Carry**:
- 2 bottles sports drink on bike (refill at aid stations)
- 5-6 gels in bento box or pockets
- Optional: 2 bananas from early aid stations
- ⚠️ **Skip aid station bars** - peanut risk

### Potential Issues
- **Stomach issues**: Back off nutrition, sip water, ease effort
- **Flat tire**: Stay calm, fix methodically (practice this!)
- **Muscle cramps**: Ease effort, consume salt/electrolytes

## T2 (Target: 2-3 minutes)

### Checklist
- ✅ Rack bike
- ✅ Helmet OFF
- ✅ Bike shoes off, run shoes on
- ✅ Race belt on with number in front
- ✅ Hat/visor on
- ✅ Grab handheld nutrition if using
- ✅ Go!

**Mental Reset**: "New race starts now. Fresh legs. Let's go!"

## Run (13.1 miles, 2:00-2:15 target = 9:00-10:00/mile pace)

### Strategy
**Miles 0-2: PATIENCE**
- Legs will feel like bricks - NORMAL
- Run conservatively, 30-60 sec slower than target pace
- Target: 9:30-10:30/mile to start
- Focus on form, short strides, quick turnover

**Miles 2-8: FIND RHYTHM**
- Settle into race pace (9:00-10:00/mile)
- Stay consistent, resist surges
- Fuel at every aid station
- Mental checkpoint every mile

**Miles 8-11: MENTAL GAME**
- This is where it gets hard
- Mantras: "Strong. Steady. One mile at a time."
- If feeling good, can start to push slightly
- Keep fueling, stay hydrated

**Miles 11-13.1: FINISH STRONG**
- Give what you have left
- Pick up pace if possible
- Walk through aid stations if needed (strategic walking is smart)
- SMILE at the finish line!

### Pacing Strategy
| Miles | Target Pace | Effort | Notes |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 0-2 | 9:30-10:30/mi | 6/10 | Get legs under you |
| 2-8 | 9:00-10:00/mi | 7.5/10 | Race pace rhythm |
| 8-11 | 9:00-10:00/mi | 8/10 | Mental toughness |
| 11-13.1 | 8:30-9:30/mi | 9/10 | Empty the tank |

**Negative Split Goal**: If executing well, second half (miles 6.55-13.1) should be equal or faster than first half.

### Run Nutrition
- **Aid stations**: Every ~1.5 miles (roughly 8-9 stations)
- **Every station**:
  - Grab sports drink (few sips)
  - Grab water (sip or pour on head if hot)
- **Every other station**: Take gel or food
  - Target: 30-60g carbs per hour (2-3 gels total)
- **Walk through aid stations**: 30 seconds of walking to fuel properly is faster than bonking

**⚠️ AVOID**: Cookies, bars, pretzels at aid stations (peanut contamination risk)

### Potential Issues
- **GI distress**: Slow down, walk, take water only, breathe
- **Cramps**: Stretch gently, salt stick, ease effort
- **Bonking**: Take multiple gels, sports drink, walk if needed
- **Heat**: Ice at aid stations, pour water on head/body

## Post-Race

**Immediate** (First 30 min):
- Cross finish line, get medal, CELEBRATE!
- Find family/friends
- Get water and food (safe options, avoid aid station bars)
- Medical tent if needed

**First 2 Hours**:
- Change into dry clothes
- Real food: Rice, pasta, fruit, safe protein
- Chocolate milk or recovery drink
- Start rehydrating

**Rest of Day**:
- Elevate legs
- Ice bath or cold plunge (optional)
- Gentle stretching
- Eat full meal within 3-4 hours
- Celebrate your accomplishment!
